### Backend

Main task of the backend is to process and forward data between frontend and the maincontroller of the auto, and to manage the database used to store users' information and statistics. The last part could not be finished because of the abrupt canceling. The backend was written by Bo-Wen Yuan and Ruslan Mammadov (alphabetically).

To start the backend, you have to install NodeJS & npm, execute once `npm install`, and then run `npm run-script start`.
