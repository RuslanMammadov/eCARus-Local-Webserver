#### Maincontroller imitator
The maincontroller imitator is a testing program, which imitates maincontroller. This program can receive and display messages that are supposed to be sent to maincontroller, and they send the message as if they were sent from maincontroller. This part was written by Ruslan Mammadov.

The programm consist of the backend, which receives, forwards and sends messages to and from webserver (from backend), and the frontend, where the received messages are logged and where the user can send messages.

To run this programm, you have to install _NPM_ & _NodeJS_, install packages with `npm install`, and run the *app.js* with `node app.js`.

The private key is an example key for development purposes and not the one which is supposed to be used in production.
