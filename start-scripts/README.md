### Starts scripts

TODO: Update scripts: use flags and parameters instead of using different script. 

TODO: Add option of running in debug mode with connected maincontroller on linux/mac.

Execute the scripts to run the server (backend and frontend). If you are using windows, use  *windows* scripts, otherwise with *normal-os* scripts. If you want to start backend and both frontends on the same computer, and maincontroller is not connected to to the computer, use *debug* scripts. If you want to start backend and both frontends on the same computer, and maincontroller is connected to the computer, use the script *start-on-windows-locally-with-mc.sh*.
